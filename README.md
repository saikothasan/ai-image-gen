# AI Image Generator

Welcome to the AI Image Generator! This web app allows users to generate stunning AI-powered images based on text prompts. Built using React, Framer Motion for animations, and powered by an AI image generation API, this tool provides an easy and intuitive interface for creating images with just a few words.

## Features

- **Fast Image Generation**: Create images in seconds powered by AI.
- **Unlimited Creativity**: Generate unique and creative images based on any text prompt.
- **High-Quality Results**: AI produces high-resolution, downloadable images.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion animations for a delightful user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - Framer Motion (for animations)
  - React Spinners (for loading state)
  - React Icons (for icons)

- **Backend**:
  - The backend API is assumed to be implemented separately (likely using Node.js or any other technology capable of handling the AI image generation request).

## Requirements

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saikothasan/ai-image-gen
   cd ai-image-gen
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Make sure you have the AI image generation API ready (you can integrate it with services like OpenAI's DALLÂ·E or any other image generation API). Update the API endpoint in the `generateImage` function of the component with the correct URL.

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the app locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`).
2. Enter a prompt (e.g., "A futuristic city at sunset") in the input field.
3. Click the **Generate Image** button.
4. Wait for the image to be generated. Once the image is ready, it will be displayed below the button.
5. If an error occurs, an error message will be displayed.

## Example Prompts

Here are some example prompts you can try to generate interesting images:

- "A serene landscape with mountains and a lake"
- "A robot walking in a neon-lit street"
- "A fantasy castle surrounded by clouds"
- "A futuristic city skyline with flying cars"

## UI Features

- **Header**: Displays the app title ("AI Image Generator").
- **Image Generation Area**: A text input where users can enter their prompts and a button to trigger the image generation.
- **About Section**: Describes the app's features and provides a brief overview of its functionality.
- **Features Section**: Lists the main features of the app with icons.
- **Footer**: Displays copyright information.

## Responsiveness

The app is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- On larger screens, the layout uses a multi-column design for the features and about sections.
- On smaller screens (mobile), the layout stacks elements vertically for easy navigation.
